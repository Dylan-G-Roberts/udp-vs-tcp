For the TCP server, use command "telnet 127.0.0.1 8080" to create a connection. Then, you can just type in whatever
you want to send to the server, hit enter to send.

For the UDP server, use the command "echo "hi" | nc -w1 -u 127.0.0.1 8081". That will send whatever you echo to the server. Server is stateless (you don't need a connection.)
